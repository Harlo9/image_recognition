# 🖋️ Handwritten Digit Recognition with Pygame and TensorFlow

This project uses **Pygame**, **TensorFlow**, and **Google Text-to-Speech** (gTTS) to create an interactive window where users can draw handwritten digits and have them recognized by a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system predicts the digit, displays the result on the screen, and speaks the digit aloud.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Pygame**: To create an interactive window for drawing.
- **TensorFlow**: For loading and using a pre-trained model to predict the drawn digits.
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**: For converting the predicted digit into speech.
- **NumPy**: For image manipulation.

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Start Drawing** ✍️:
   - Left-click on the Pygame window to start drawing digits.
   - Draw your number with the mouse.

2. **Clear the Screen** ✨:
   - Press the **Spacebar (Space)** to clear the window.

3. **Predict the Digit** 🔍:
   - Once you've drawn a digit, press the **Enter (Return)** key to predict it.
   - The predicted digit will be displayed on the screen and read aloud.

4. **Exit** 🚪:
   - Close the window to exit the program.

## 🔧 Features

- **Handwriting Input** 🖊️: Draw any digit on the screen.
- **Digit Recognition** 🤖: Uses a trained CNN model to recognize the digit.
- **Text-to-Speech** 🗣️: The digit is spoken aloud using gTTS.
- **Clear Screen** ✨: Press **Spacebar** to reset the drawing area.
- **Interactive Interface** 💻: Simple interaction using mouse events and keyboard shortcuts.
